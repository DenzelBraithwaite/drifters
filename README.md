# <mark>Update coming soon, will need to update all photos as the design has been revamped.</mark>
# <mark>[Drifters Beta](http://drifters.website) is no longer available, so the game can't be accessed right now, but I'm working on a new url to host it. I've completed the first version of the game (meaning you can compelete a full playthrough and receive an ending, but changes and updates are still to be expected), I had taken the game down to work on it, but now it's ready again, stay tuned for v1.0.1.</mark>

**What is Drifters?**

In Drifters, you play as a nameless person with amnesia who's in an unknown world confronted by a mysterious being called Jude. Jude forces you to answer a series of questions where your decisions will impact the overall story of the game. Much of the story is shrouded in mystery and the goal is to survive long enough until you recover your memories and discover where you are. The game has a dark and mysterious feel to it and isn't intended for children, but teens should be fine. The game is currently in development but can be accessed using this link -> [Drifters Beta](http://drifters.website) which will be available from Oct/2023 until Sept/2024. That site will hold stable beta versions of the game, when it is complete I will decide if I want to change the website url or not.

**What's the gameplay like?**

The gameplay is very simplistic, you have the main game client which will display all cards that you interact with during the game. Each card will have some sort of dialogue and you'll be able to decide between 2 different replies. Different replies will give you different dialogue, and different decisions will have an impact on your gameplay. For instance, the game consists of you trying to keep your 'stats' in good condition. Kind of like the sims, if you never go to the bathroom, you will pee on the floor. In this game however, there's no fear of peeing but you will die if any of your stats hit 0 (_with the exception of 2 stats_). The stats are revealed as you play and are determined based on your decisions, the only stat that never decreases is your **memory**. Your memory is how you progress through the game and it will only ever increase as you answer questions/cards.

Your first stat will be health, but your icon that represents your health depends on your answers. Why is that important? You'll find out near the end of the game! Each decision you make will either raise or lower certain stats, so you must balance them and try to progress as far as you can. Currently, the penalty for dying has not been decided and no endings have been released, but dying will likely restart the current chapter you're on. To progress, you need to collect 'memory', which you'll gather as you continue to interact with different people. At certain levels of memory, you unlock new decks, new dialogue, and progress to further chapters.

These details are subject to change, but overall that should give you a good feel of what kind of game this is. A decision based story driven card game with an ominous setting. The game is a web app so it's point and click.

**What about mobile?**

Currently, the game is unplayable on mobile because of how I handle the decisions (hover and click). You can't hover on mobile and I would need to recreate some logic for mobile devices. Honestly, there's a good chance I never do that because I'm moving towards the game engine Godot. With Godot I'll be able to make games that can be released on steam and mobile, so perhaps one day I'll port it over.
